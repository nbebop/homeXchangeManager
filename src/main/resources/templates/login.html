    <h2>How much it costs?</h2>
    <p>Home Exchange Manager operates on a free-of-charge basis. The exchanges facilitated through our platform are
        completely free. Instead of paying for accommodation, you exchange your home with another member, allowing both
        parties to enjoy a vacation without the expense of traditional accommodation.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that while the accommodation is free, there might be additional expenses associated with your
        vacation, such as transportation, meals, and activities. However, the cost savings on accommodation can
        significantly contribute to a more affordable and immersive travel experience.</p>
